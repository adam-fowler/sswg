## Introduction

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest provider of cloud services. Many companies rely on the systems and automation they provide. These include storage, security, identity, messaging, databases, compute, machine learning and analytics to mention a few.

AWS provides SDKs to interact with their services using the languages Javascript, Go, Python, C#, PHP, C++, Java, Ruby but don't provide a first-party, fully comprehensive SDK in Swift.

Soto provides a Swift NIO based interface to access all Amazon Web Services.

## Motivation

There are many Swift libraries that provide access to one or maybe two AWS services. But many teams working in the AWS ecosystem leverage multiple services, typically within the same application codebase. Having to deal with multiple libraries with different APIs, signing and serialisation code is not ideal.

The main purpose of Soto project is to rectify the lack of comprehensive Swift SDK for AWS. The project provides access to all AWS services through a consistent API that is closely integrated with Swift NIO.

### Proposed solution

Soto is a Swift based interface to Amazon Web Services. It supports Linux, macOS and iOS. It is split into three sections.

1) The core functionality repository [soto-core](https://github.com/soto-project/soto-core). This is a NIO 2.0 based module. Requests to the core return an `EventLoopFuture` that will be populated with results at a later point. The core module encodes requests, signs requests using AWS credentials, sends them to AWS and then decodes the response.

2) [Soto](https://github.com/soto-project/soto) contains the service API files. Each AWS service has its own target which contains a service client object along with its operations and their input and output structures. The operations map to the REST api of the AWS service.

3) The Code Generator which builds the service API files mentioned in section 2. This uses the JSON model files Amazon provides (which are synced from Amazon's [aws-sdk-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/tree/master/models) repository) to generate Swift versions of the service APIs. It loads the model files using `Codable` and then outputs the Swift service files using the templating engine [Stencil](https://github.com/stencilproject/Stencil).

### Releases

The current official release of Soto is 4.9.0. For this proposal though I will be proposing what will become v5.0.0. A beta release of v5.0.0 has already been released which includes all that is detailed below.

## Detailed design

The SDK consists of two main parts. The client object `AWSClient` which does all the communication with AWS and manages your AWS credentials and the service objects which each contain the configuration setup for communicating with a specific AWS service and functions for each of the individual operations available to that service.

### AWSClient

The `AWSClient` holds your credential information and HTTP client and is the control room of the Soto project. All requests to AWS go through it. When initialising the `AWSClient` you can provide credentials directly as in the sample code below, but the client can also extract credentials from environment variables, the ~/.aws/credentials file in your home directory, from EC2 instance metadata or ECS provided credentials.

For the HTTP client you can either provide your own or let it create its own. If left to create its own HTTP client it will use the `HTTPClient` from the swift-server library `async-http-client`.

It is generally best practice to have only the one `AWSClient` in your Application.

```swift
let awsClient = AWSClient(
    credentialProvider: .static(accessKeyId: "Your-Access-Key", secretAccessKey: "Your-Secret-Key"),
    httpClientProvider: .createNew
)
```

### Service Object

Each AWS service has it's own target and in that target a service object containing the service configuration and service API. These can be created as and when they are needed.

```swift
import SotoDynamoDB
let dynamoDB = DynamoDB(client: awsClient, region: .euwest1)
```

### Operations

Once you have your service object you can call AWS operations from it. The general structure is create request object, call operation with request object which returns a NIO `EventLoopFuture` that will be fulfilled with the response from the call later on. A simple example would be as follows.

```swift
func downloadFile(filename: String, bucket: String) -> EventLoopFuture<ByteBuffer?> {
    let s3 = S3(client: awsClient, region: .useast1)
    let request = S3.GetObjectRequest(bucket: bucket, key: filename)
    return s3.getObject(request).map { $0.body?.asByteBuffer() }
}
```
This downloads a file from S3 and returns an `EventLoopFuture` that will receive the file contents.

As the SDK returns `EventLoopFutures` these can be chained together to produce more complex behaviours. As in the following example.

```swift
let cloudTrail = CloudTrail(client: awsClient, region:.euwest1)
let ses = SES(client: awsClient, region:.euwest1)

let request = CloudTrail.LookupEventsRequest(
    endTime: Date(),
    lookupAttributes: [.init(attributeKey: .username, attributeValue: "adamfowler")],
    startTime: Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: -24*60*60)
)
let response = cloudTrail.lookupEvents(request)
    .map { $0.events ?? [] }
    .flatMap { events -> EventLoopFuture<SES.SendEmailResponse> in
        let messageBody = "Usage:\n\(events.description)"
        let messageSubject = "Usage report for Adam Fowler"
        let request = SES.SendEmailRequest(
            destination: SES.Destination(toAddresses: ["joesmith@soto-project.org"]),
            message: .init(body:.init(text:.init(data:messageBody)), subject: .init(data: messageSubject)),
            source: "admin@soto-project.org")
        return ses.sendEmail(request)
}
```
Here we are generating a Cloud Trail report detailing all the AWS events generated by user "adamfowler" in the last 24 hours and then sending it as an email to joesmith@soto-project.org using the Simple Email Service.

### Code Generation

Soto provides interfaces for over 200 different AWS services. Each of these services has its own library. The service library code is generated from json model files supplied by Amazon, which we get via their [aws-sdk-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/tree/master/models) repository. The Soto project includes a Code Generation tool which loads the json model files using `Codable` and generates Swift code for each service using a custom version of the templating library [Stencil](https://github.com/stencilproject/Stencil).

AWS have a new interface modeling language [Smithy](https://awslabs.github.io/smithy/). They have Smithy models for all the AWS services and are using these to generate code for their [`aws-sdk-go-v2`](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2) developer preview library. We are aware of this and are actively looking to support it once regular model updates are published.   

### Additional functionality

#### Pagination

Many AWS operations return lists of items. These can be of an undefined length, so to avoid returning overly large responses pagination is a commmon pattern used across the services. For each operation that returns paginated results the SDK provides an additional function, with suffix "Paginator", for extracting all the results. The Cloud Trail example from above would only ever return the first 50 events in the list, as that is the maximum number of events the function is allowed to return. We can use the pagintor version of the function to extract all the events in the following manner.

```swift
var events: [CloudTrail.Event] = []
let request = CloudTrail.LookupEventsRequest(
    endTime:TimeStamp(Date()),
    lookupAttributes: [.init(attributeKey: .username, attributeValue: "adamfowler")],
    startTime: TimeStamp(Date(timeIntervalSinceNow: -24*60*60))
)
let response = cloudTrail.lookupEventsPaginator(request) { response, eventLoop in
    if let eventsPage = response.events {
        events.append(contentsOf: eventsPage)
    }
    return eventLoop.makeSucceededFuture(true)
}
```
The supplied closure appends results, supplied to it by the paginator function, to the `events` array. When finished, `events` should hold all the Cloud Trail events. 

#### Streaming Request data

Where an operation expects a raw data payload. It is possible to stream that data. Instead of providing a single `ByteBuffer` you can provide a closure that supplies your data in smaller chunks. This is useful for situations where you don't want to store all your data in memory at one point.

```swift
func streamData(eventLoop: EventLoop) -> EventLoopFuture<ByteBuffer> {
    let buffer = getNextChunk() // your function returning the next chunk from your buffer
    return eventLoop.makeSucceededFuture(buffer)
}
let request = S3.PutObjectRequest(body: .stream(size: totalDataSize, streamData), bucket: "myBucket", key: "myFile")
let response = s3.putObject(request)
```
Here we are uploading a block of data supplied in chunks by the function `getNextChunk()` to an S3 bucket. Given the most popular use of this will probably be uploading files, there is also a `fileHandle` wrapper to `stream` that takes an `NIOFileHandle`.  

#### Streaming response data

If an operation returns a raw data payload the SDK supplies an extra function, with suffix "Streaming", for receiving that raw payload in the smaller chunks that are passed through the HTTP Client.

```swift
    let kinesisVideo = KinesisVideoMedia(client: awsClient, endpoint: myVideoEndpoint)
    let request = KinesisVideoMedia.GetMediaInput(startSelector: .init(startSelectorType: .now), streamName: "myVideo")
    _ = kinesisVideo.getMediaStreaming(request) { byteBuffer, eventLoop in
        processMediaData() // your function processing byte buffer returned from HTTP client ...
        return eventLoop.makeSucceededFuture(())
    }
```
The code above is streaming media content from a Kinesis video stream. The closure processes the byte buffers as they come through the HTTP client. It returns an eventLoop which is fulfilled when each buffer has been processed, in this case immediately.

### Swift server eco-system

Soto is heavily integrated in the Swift server eco-system. It uses Swift server projects [swift-nio](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio), [async-http-client](https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client), [swift-crypto](https://github.com/apple/swift-crypto), [swift-log](https://github.com/apple/swift-log) and [swift-metrics](https://github.com/apple/swift-metrics). The plan is also to integrate with the swift tracing library when that becomes available.

### Swift AWS Lambda runtime

We think that Soto is the perfect match for the recently released Swift AWS Lambda runtime, providing access to all your AWS resources from your Swift developed Lambda functions.

## Maturity Justification

Soto adheres to the minimal requirements of the [SSWG Incubation Process](https://github.com/swift-server/sswg/blob/master/process/incubation.md#minimal-requirements). The project is fairly mature and has had five different developers working on it over a three year period, although at the moment the majority of work is done by one developer. I don't know if this is good enough for the 2+ developers requirement.  

## Alternatives considered

AWS already provide an iOS targetted SDK [aws-sdk-ios](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-ios), but this is written almost exclusively in Objective C so is no use for server side Swift which is required to run on non-Darwin platforms.

Another alternative to Soto is [smoke-aws](https://github.com/amzn/smoke-aws) which is part of the Amazon developed Smoke framework. For AWS they have generated code for a small set of services. In theory their code generator should be able to generate code for all AWS services. While the internals of Smoke do use Swift NIO, their API uses callbacks instead of `EventLoopFuture` making it harder to integrate with other Swift NIO based systems.

Thanks for taking the time to read this proposal and we are looking forward to hear your comments and suggestions.
